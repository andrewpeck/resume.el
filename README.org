* resume.el

This package provides some simple infrastructure for generating LaTex and HTML resumes from an elisp datastructure. Quite opinionated and special purpose (for me) but if you aren't too picky or share my opinions or are willing to hack a bit it should work for you as well.

What problem does this solve? I wanted both HTML and PDF versions of the same resume.

And of course the best way to do this is in emacs...
